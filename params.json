So far\r\n\r\n#This was originally to solidfy my skills\r\nBut now it's become a hobby, as creating trees in code is actually quite cool. In this library you will find code that creates a BST \r\nand, not working code, that is meant to create an AVL (work in progress).\r\n\r\n##Hello internet wonderers\r\nIf you wish to use my code, feel free, fork, clone or down right copy and paste all you like, all I ask is that:\r\n(i) if you're here to learn, that you learn and reference me (up732011@myport.ac.uk).\r\n(ii) if you're using this to actually create something, cool!\r\n",
