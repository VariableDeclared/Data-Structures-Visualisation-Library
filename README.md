# utilLib
A little library that i've written to solidify learnt skills. Includes Binary Search Trees and AVLs... So far

#This was originally to solidfy my skills
But now it's become a hobby, as creating trees in code is actually quite cool. In this library you will find code that creates a BST 
and, not working code, that is meant to create an AVL (work in progress).

##Hello internet wonderers
If you wish to use my code, feel free, fork, clone or down right copy and paste all you like, all I ask is that:
(i) if you're here to learn, that you learn and reference me (up732011@myport.ac.uk).
(ii) if you're using this to actually create something, cool!
